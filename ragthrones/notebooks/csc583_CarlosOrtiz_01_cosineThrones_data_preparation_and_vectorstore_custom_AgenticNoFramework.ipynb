        "API keys are never hardcoded, ensuring the workflow is secure, portable, and version-controlled safely.\n",

        "- Parses and normalizes every subtitle line into a structured chronological DataFrame.  \n",

        "- Optionally crawls FunTrivia to collect human-written GOT QA for later evaluation.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **3. Chunking & Dataset Augmentation**\n",
        "Subtitle lines are windowed into overlapping narrative chunks.  \n",
        "Lore entries are converted into parallel chunks with metadata (`chunk_kind = \"character_lore\"`).  \n",

        "   over the merged subtitles + lore dataset (`df_aug`).\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **Reranker (Optional)**  \n",
        "   If available, a cross-encoder (ms-marco-MiniLM) reorders retrieved chunks by semantic relevance.  \n",
        "   If not available, retrieval results flow through untouched.\n",

        "   Formats evidence into a tightly controlled, citation-first prompt.  \n",
        "   Calls the generation model (e.g., `gpt-4o-mini`) and produces a grounded, one-sentence answer  \n",
        "   that must rely **only** on visible evidence.\n",
        "\n",
        "### **The State Object (Your Own LangGraph Alternative)**\n",

        "It runs only once per session, or reruns automatically if the underlying chunk dataframe changes.\n",
        "\n",
        "The setup performs four major tasks:\n",
        "\n",
        "1. **Embedding Generation (or Loading Artifacts)**  \n",
        "   The system uses a single embedding model (`text-embedding-3-large`) and generates vector embeddings for all text chunks.  \n",
        "   If previously saved vector files or FAISS indexes are found in the `data/` directory, these are loaded instead of recomputed.\n",
        "\n",
        "2. **FAISS Index Construction**  \n",
        "   The vectors are normalized and stored in a FAISS inner-product index for efficient semantic search.  \n",
        "   If an index already exists, it is loaded and validated. If loading fails, the index is rebuilt automatically.\n",
        "\n",
        "3. **BM25 Token-Based Retrieval**  \n",
        "   Each chunk is tokenized and indexed using BM25 (RankBM25). This provides a complementary sparse retrieval pathway that helps catch lexical matches missed by embeddings.\n",
        "\n",
        "4. **Hybrid Search Initialization**  \n",
        "   A single `hybrid_search()` function combines FAISS similarity scores and BM25 scores to produce a ranked list of candidate chunks.  \n",
        "   It includes safety checks for index length mismatches, truncated vectors, missing embeddings, and out-of-range FAISS hits.\n",
        "\n",
        "Together, these components form the notebook’s unified retrieval layer, enabling fast, stable, and repeatable semantic + lexical search over the Game of Thrones subtitle corpus."

            "[S?E?] ===Jon Snow=== '''Jon Snow''' portrayed by Kit Harington. Kit Harington Jon Snow of House Stark and the Night's Watch is the secret son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, though raised as the bastard son of Lyanna's brother, Ned Stark. In the first season, Jon joins the Night's Watch. Jon is a talented fighter, but his sense of compassion and justice brings him into conflict with his harsh surroundings. Ned claims that Jon's mother was a wet nurse named Wylla. His dire wolf is called Ghost due to his albinism and quiet nature. Jon soon learns that the Watch is no longer a glorious order, but is now composed mostly of society's rejects, including criminals and exiles. Initially, he has only contempt for his low-born brothers of the Watch, but he puts aside his prejudices and befriends his fellow recruits, especially Samwell Tarly, after they unite against the cruel master-at-arms, Ser Alliser Thorne.\n",
            "[S7E3] Protector of the Seven Kingdoms, the Mother of Dragons, the Khaleesi of the Great Grass Sea, the Unburnt, the Breaker of Chains. This is Jon Snow.\n",
            "[S?E?] === Jon Snow === Jon Snow was raised as Ned Stark's illegitimate son and serves as the point of view character in 42 chapters throughout ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', ''A Storm of Swords'', and ''A Dance with Dragons''. He shares the Stark family values of honour, and tries to stay morally correct and honest, even when forced to act otherwise.  He is theorized to be the son of Lyanna Stark, Ned Stark's sister, and Rhaegar Targaryen. In the HBO television adaptation, he is portrayed by Kit Harington.\n",
            "[S?E?] ===Parentage=== The identity of Jon's mother has created much speculation among readers of the series, and guessing her identity was the test Martin gave Benioff and Weiss when they approached him in March 2006 about adapting his novels into a TV series. In the novels, Martin hints that she could be a servant named Wylla, or the noblewoman Ashara Dayne. The popular fan theory—called \"R+L=J\", an abbreviation of \"Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon\"—proposes that Jon is not the son of Ned at all, but is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned's younger sister Lyanna Stark. Though the character is presented as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark,  David Orr voiced the doubt of some readers when he wrote in ''The New York Times'' in 2011, \"Jon Snow is presented as the illegitimate son of the Stark patriarch, although it's uncertain whether Stark is indeed his father.\" Actor Sean Bean, who portrays Ned in the HBO television series, said when asked in a 2014 interview about returning to the series to appear in flashbacks, \"I've definitely got some unfinished business that needs to be resolved there. I'm obviously not Jon Snow's dad. And you need that to be revealed at some point, don't you?\" The uncertainty arises from anecdotal evidence in the texts interpreted by readers to connect the mysterious maternity of Ned's son with the vague backstory of his sister Lyanna. As recounted by Ned in ''A Game of Thrones'', at a tourney years before the events of the novel, Rhaegar had shown public favor to Lyanna in the presence of his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell. When Rhaegar and Lyanna disappeared a year later, her father Rickard and eldest brother Brandon confronted Rhaegar's father, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, demanding that his son return the abducted Lyanna. Aerys had Rickard and Brandon brutally executed for their insolence, inciting Ned and his friend Robert Baratheon, Lord of  Storm's End and Lyanna's betrothed, to rebel against Aerys. In what later became known as Robert's Rebellion, Aerys was overthrown and Rhaegar was killed by Robert in single combat. After a bloody battle against three of Aerys' Kingsguard protecting the Tower of Joy in Dorne, Ned found Lyanna inside, in a \"bed of blood.\" She died shortly after eliciting a promise from Ned. Once the war was won, he returned to Winterfell with his illegitimate son Jon. The R+L=J theory posits that rather than Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna, they fell in love and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a child—Jon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth. Ned promised Lyanna on her deathbed to claim the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne. HBO's ''Game of Thrones'' has included in its adaptation many of the \"hints\" identified by this theory. In the season 6 finale, \"The Winds of Winter\", Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. Lyanna makes him promise to protect her son—Jon. An infographic subsequently posted on the HBO-controlled website MakingGameofThrones.com confirmed Rhaegar as Jon's father. Journalists later commented on the significance of two plot points in the season 7 episode \"Eastwatch\". One of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, Drogon, approaches Jon calmly and allows the King in the North to pet him, seemingly recognizing him as a Targaryen. Later, Gilly learns from a book at the Citadel that a High Septon annulled Rhaegar's marriage, and married him to someone else in Dorne, suggesting the possibility that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. The season 7 finale episode \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" confirmed that Jon is indeed the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and that his birth name is actually Aegon Targaryen.\n",

            "[S?E?] ===Jon Snow=== '''Jon Snow''' portrayed by Kit Harington. Kit Harington Jon Snow of House Stark and the Night's Watch is the secret son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Lyanna Stark, though raised as the bastard son of Lyanna's brother, Ned Stark. In the first season, Jon joins the Night's Watch. Jon is a talented fighter, but his sense of compassion and justice brings him into conflict with his harsh surroundings. Ned claims that Jon's mother was a wet nurse named Wylla. His dire wolf is called Ghost due to his albinism and quiet nature. Jon soon learns that the Watch is no longer a glorious order, but is now composed mostly of society's rejects, including criminals and exiles. Initially, he has only contempt for his low-born brothers of the Watch, but he puts aside his prejudices and befriends his fellow recruits, especially Samwell Tarly, after they unite against the cruel master-at-arms, Ser Alliser Thorne.\n",

            "[S?E?] === Jon Snow === Jon Snow was raised as Ned Stark's illegitimate son and serves as the point of view character in 42 chapters throughout ''A Game of Thrones'', ''A Clash of Kings'', ''A Storm of Swords'', and ''A Dance with Dragons''. He shares the Stark family values of honour, and tries to stay morally correct and honest, even when forced to act otherwise.  He is theorized to be the son of Lyanna Stark, Ned Stark's sister, and Rhaegar Targaryen. In the HBO television adaptation, he is portrayed by Kit Harington.\n",
            "[S?E?] ===Parentage=== The identity of Jon's mother has created much speculation among readers of the series, and guessing her identity was the test Martin gave Benioff and Weiss when they approached him in March 2006 about adapting his novels into a TV series. In the novels, Martin hints that she could be a servant named Wylla, or the noblewoman Ashara Dayne. The popular fan theory—called \"R+L=J\", an abbreviation of \"Rhaegar + Lyanna = Jon\"—proposes that Jon is not the son of Ned at all, but is actually the son of Rhaegar Targaryen and Ned's younger sister Lyanna Stark. Though the character is presented as the illegitimate son of Ned Stark,  David Orr voiced the doubt of some readers when he wrote in ''The New York Times'' in 2011, \"Jon Snow is presented as the illegitimate son of the Stark patriarch, although it's uncertain whether Stark is indeed his father.\" Actor Sean Bean, who portrays Ned in the HBO television series, said when asked in a 2014 interview about returning to the series to appear in flashbacks, \"I've definitely got some unfinished business that needs to be resolved there. I'm obviously not Jon Snow's dad. And you need that to be revealed at some point, don't you?\" The uncertainty arises from anecdotal evidence in the texts interpreted by readers to connect the mysterious maternity of Ned's son with the vague backstory of his sister Lyanna. As recounted by Ned in ''A Game of Thrones'', at a tourney years before the events of the novel, Rhaegar had shown public favor to Lyanna in the presence of his own wife, the Dornish princess Elia Martell. When Rhaegar and Lyanna disappeared a year later, her father Rickard and eldest brother Brandon confronted Rhaegar's father, the Mad King Aerys Targaryen, demanding that his son return the abducted Lyanna. Aerys had Rickard and Brandon brutally executed for their insolence, inciting Ned and his friend Robert Baratheon, Lord of  Storm's End and Lyanna's betrothed, to rebel against Aerys. In what later became known as Robert's Rebellion, Aerys was overthrown and Rhaegar was killed by Robert in single combat. After a bloody battle against three of Aerys' Kingsguard protecting the Tower of Joy in Dorne, Ned found Lyanna inside, in a \"bed of blood.\" She died shortly after eliciting a promise from Ned. Once the war was won, he returned to Winterfell with his illegitimate son Jon. The R+L=J theory posits that rather than Rhaegar kidnapping Lyanna, they fell in love and ran away together. Living for a year in the Tower of Joy, they conceived a child—Jon. Rhaegar was killed in battle by Robert, and Lyanna died in childbirth. Ned promised Lyanna on her deathbed to claim the baby as his own to protect him from Robert, who sought to exterminate all Targaryens out of hatred and to secure his claim to the throne. HBO's ''Game of Thrones'' has included in its adaptation many of the \"hints\" identified by this theory. In the season 6 finale, \"The Winds of Winter\", Bran Stark has a vision of the past which shows Ned reuniting with a dying Lyanna in the Tower of Joy. Lyanna makes him promise to protect her son—Jon. An infographic subsequently posted on the HBO-controlled website MakingGameofThrones.com confirmed Rhaegar as Jon's father. Journalists later commented on the significance of two plot points in the season 7 episode \"Eastwatch\". One of Daenerys Targaryen's dragons, Drogon, approaches Jon calmly and allows the King in the North to pet him, seemingly recognizing him as a Targaryen. Later, Gilly learns from a book at the Citadel that a High Septon annulled Rhaegar's marriage, and married him to someone else in Dorne, suggesting the possibility that Jon is the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna. The season 7 finale episode \"The Dragon and the Wolf\" confirmed that Jon is indeed the legitimate son of Rhaegar and Lyanna, and that his birth name is actually Aegon Targaryen.\n",
